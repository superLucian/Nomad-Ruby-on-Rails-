        %p Nomad Credit connects international students and/or visa holders currently or planning to live in the U.S. with potential credit card providers based on the search profile they submit on our platform. One of the difficulties for an international student or visa holder to obtain financing in the U.S. is the lack of a credit history. Credit cards are a way to start building your credit. Purchases shouldnâ€™t have to be made solely with cash. With the credit card options available, Nomad Credit wants customers to make informed credit card decisions based on their situation and needs. Nomad Credit can connect you with the credit card providers that will serve international students or visa holders in the U.S. Once you see your options, Nomad Credit will be there to help you through the process and answer any questions that you may have.
