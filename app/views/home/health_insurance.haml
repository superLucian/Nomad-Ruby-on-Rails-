        %p Nomad Credit connects customers with potential student medical insurers based on the search profile they submit on our platform. International students are required to purchase medical insurance during their stay in the United States. Many universities have their own student medical insurance plans. However, depending upon the university and whether the international student is an F1 visa or J1 visa, the international student may be able to search for private student medical insurance options. Through our partners, we can help provide the necessary insurance products to make sure that you have the right coverage for your health while you study in the United States. Once you see your options, Nomad Credit will be there to help you through the process and answer any questions that you may have.
