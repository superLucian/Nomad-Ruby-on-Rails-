        %p Nomad Credit connects customers with potential renters insurers based on the search profile they fill out on our platform. Regardless of age or citizenship, everyone could use renters insurance. Insuring your property can protect you in the event of theft or natural disasters. Additionally, many landlords require a cosigner on a lease. This can be difficult for international students to attain. Through our partners, we can help provide the necessary renters insurance products to make sure that you have the right coverage. Once you see your options, Nomad Credit will be there to help you through the process and answer any questions that you may have.
